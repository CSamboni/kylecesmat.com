- Built with next.js & preact
- Giving glamor a shot for styling
- Hosting TBD, likely `now`

### Goals
- Easy to write using markdown
- Simple to update, keep content pulled out of app
- Low-boilerplate or decision-making, hopefully `npm install` works in 3 years

### Dev
- `dev` to spin up dev env
- `build` to make a build
- `start` to serve from `./next`
- use `now` service to make a deployment
